⚠️ Disclaimer : this will overwrite any exisiting config file (rofi, polybar, tlp)⚠️

- Download the [installer](https://github.com/maxlttr/wm/blob/main/installer.sh) , make it executable and run it:

Directly copy and paste all the following commands in your terminal
```sh
cd ~/
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxlttr/wm/main/installer.sh
chmod +x installer.sh
./installer.sh
```
